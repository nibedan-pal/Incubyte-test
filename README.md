
## Introduction


Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB I have built a Full Stack MERN Application - from start to finish. The App is called "Incubyte Memories" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives.

- User can Create, Read, Update and Delete their post
- Each Post has creator,title, message, tags and photo

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the app
